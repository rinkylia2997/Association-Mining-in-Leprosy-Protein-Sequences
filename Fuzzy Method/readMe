The fuzzy.py file contains the python code that incorporates the fuzzy logic while mining.
The fuzzy.fasta file is the input file that contains leprosy sequences.
The r_fuzzy contains the results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.

******************************************
## KEY NOTES -

### The fuzzy approach (second code) is more sophisticated because it:

Normalizes amino acid presence by sequence length
Uses membership values (proportions) instead of raw counts
Treats each sequence equally regardless of length
Better captures compositional patterns rather than just frequency

### The crisp approach (first code) is simpler and:

Uses raw counts directly
Faster to compute
Better when sequences are similar length
More traditional frequent pattern mining

******************************************
## Major Differences between CRISP and FUZZY methods 

### 1. Support Calculation Method - THE KEY DIFFERENCE
CRISP (First Code):
python# Uses raw counts of amino acids
s = sum(bio_df['lenTitle'])  # Total amino acids across all sequences
sup_amino[key] = values/s     # Support = count / total amino acids

Divides by total number of amino acids across all sequences
Example: If 'A' appears 1000 times and total amino acids = 10000, support = 0.10

FUZZY (Second Code):
python# Uses membership values (proportions within each sequence)
num_of_sequences = len(fuzzy_df)        # Total number of sequences
sup_item[key] = values/num_of_sequences # Support = sum of memberships / number of sequences

Divides by number of sequences
Uses normalized proportions (membership values)


### 2. Data Representation
CRISP (First Code):
pythonbio_df columns: ['idTitle', 'lenTitle', 'seqTitle', 'A', 'C', 'D', ...]
# 'A', 'C', 'D' contain RAW COUNTS

Example for sequence "AAALLGG":
A = 3  (raw count)
L = 2  (raw count)
G = 2  (raw count)
FUZZY (Second Code):
python# Creates NORMALIZED proportions (membership values)
a_list = [float(ai)/bi for ai,bi in zip(bio_df['A'],bio_df['lenTitle'])]

fuzzy_df columns: ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', ...]
# Contains PROPORTIONS (0 to 1)

Example for sequence "AAALLGG" (length=7):
A = 3/7 = 0.428  (proportion)
L = 2/7 = 0.286  (proportion)
G = 2/7 = 0.286  (proportion)

### 3. Membership Calculation
CRISP (First Code):
python# No membership concept
# Just counts occurrences
amino_count = {}
for i in list_of_list:
    for j in i:
        if j in amino_count:
            amino_count[j] += 1

Simple frequency counting

FUZZY (Second Code):
python# Calculates membership values for each amino acid
a_mem = sum(a_list)/len(a_list)  # Average proportion across all sequences
c_mem = sum(c_list)/len(a_list)
...

# Creates membership dictionary
fuzzy_1 = dict(zip(a, fuzzy))

Calculates average membership (mean proportion) of each amino acid across all sequences
Represents "how much" an amino acid belongs to the dataset
