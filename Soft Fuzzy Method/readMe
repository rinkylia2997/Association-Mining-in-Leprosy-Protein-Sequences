The soft_fuzzy.py file contains the python code that incorporates the fuzzy logic while categorizing each sequence into low length, medium length and large length sequences while mining.
The soft_fuzzy.fasta file is the input file that contains leprosy sequences.
The r_softFuzzy_low contains the low length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_softFuzzy_medium contains the medium length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_softFuzzy_high contains the high length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.

## Characteristics: of SOFT FUZZY

Normalized proportions (membership values)
Three length-based groups
Divides by number of sequences in each group
Best of both worlds: Length-aware + normalized

*****************************************

## **Practical Decision Tree**
```
Are your sequences similar length (< 20% variation)?
├─ YES → Use CRISP (fast, simple, sufficient)
└─ NO → Continue...

Do you need to compare patterns across length ranges?
├─ YES → Continue...
│   └─ Do you have computational resources?
│       ├─ YES → Use SOFT-FUZZY ⭐ (best accuracy)
│       └─ NO → Use SOFT (good compromise)
│
└─ NO → Use FUZZY (good normalization, simpler)

## **Which One is BEST?**

### **🥇 Best Overall: SOFT-FUZZY (Code 4)**

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Sequences vary significantly in length (e.g., 50-500 amino acids)
- ✅ You want the most accurate, unbiased analysis
- ✅ Need to discover length-specific compositional patterns
- ✅ Research/publication quality results
- ✅ You have computational resources and time

**Why Best:**
1. **Eliminates length bias completely** - normalizes within each sequence
2. **Discovers length-dependent patterns** - separate analysis per group
3. **Most accurate representation** - proportion-based within length groups
4. **Fair comparison** - each sequence contributes equally within its group
5. **Comprehensive insights** - can compare patterns across length ranges

**Example Use Case:**
```
Protein dataset: Signal peptides (20-40 aa), domains (100-200 aa), 
full proteins (300-800 aa)

SOFT-FUZZY will:
- Normalize composition within each sequence
- Group similar-length sequences
- Find patterns specific to short, medium, long proteins
- Avoid long proteins dominating the analysis
```

### **🥈 Second Best: FUZZY (Code 2)**

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Sequences have variable lengths but you want overall patterns
- ✅ Simpler analysis needed
- ✅ Don't need length-specific insights
- ✅ Faster results required

**Why Good:**
- Normalizes for length differences
- Simpler than Soft-Fuzzy
- Good balance of accuracy and speed

---

### **🥉 Third Best: SOFT (Code 3)**

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Need length-based grouping
- ✅ Raw counts are meaningful (e.g., absolute abundance matters)
- ✅ Simpler than Soft-Fuzzy

**Why Moderate:**
- Groups by length (good)
- But doesn't normalize within sequences (less ideal)
- Long sequences in each group still have more influence

---

### **❌ Least Recommended: CRISP (Code 1)**

**When to Use:**
- ✅ All sequences are similar length (±10%)
- ✅ Quick exploratory analysis
- ✅ Teaching/learning purposes
- ✅ Computational constraints

**Why Limited:**
- No length normalization
- No grouping
- Biased toward longer sequences
- Only use if sequences are uniform length
