The soft.py file contains the python code that incorporates the fuzzy logic while categorizing each sequence into low length, medium length and large length sequences while mining.
The soft.fasta file is the input file that contains leprosy sequences.
The r_soft_low contains the low length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_soft_medium contains the medium length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_soft_high contains the high length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.

*************************************************

## MAIN CONCEPT: Length-Based Partitioning
This code splits sequences into THREE groups based on length and analyzes each group separately:

LOW: Short sequences
MEDIUM: Medium-length sequences
HIGH: Long sequences

**************************************************

## KEY ADVANTAGES OF SOFT Approach

### Discovers length-specific patterns

Short proteins might have different amino acid composition than long ones
Certain patterns might only appear in specific length ranges


### Prevents length bias

Each group analyzed independently
Long sequences don't dominate the results


### More granular analysis

Can compare patterns across length groups
Understand how composition changes with length


### Flexible thresholds

Can apply different minimum support for each group if needed

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use CRISP when:

Sequences are relatively uniform in length
You want overall patterns across all sequences
Simplicity is preferred
Computational resources are limited

### Use SOFT when:

Sequences vary significantly in length (e.g., 50-1000 amino acids)
You want to discover length-dependent patterns
Different protein families with different typical lengths
Need to compare short vs. medium vs. long protein characteristics
